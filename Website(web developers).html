    <h2 style = "text-align:left; font-size: larger;"> Web developer 1: </h2>
      <p style = "font-size: large; text-align: center;"> Hi my name is Alex, the course I have done was web design. In my opinion I really enjoyed it. My course took around two years to complete which was worth it since now it will stand out on my CV and help to me to find a job.
        I recommend either learning HTML at home or following a course since it is a key component in Web Design since that is the programming language used. </p>
      <p style = "font-size: large; text-align: center;"> What I did in my course was: report technical problems to IT support staff, analyse statistics about who is using the website, write reports for managers, clients and partners and also I did the basic work using a content management systems(CMS).
        When completing the course, you can now become a lead web designer or manager, work as a freelance designer or set up your own web design business.</p>

    <h2 style = "text-align:left; font-size: larger;">Web developer 2: </h2>
      <p style = "font-size: large; text-align: center;">Hello my name is Katherine. The course I did was a HTML course. My course took about 1 year to complete. I chose to learn HTML so then I could make websites from my own home and hopefully make a business from it.</p>
      <p style = "font-size: large; text-align: center;"> Even though I struggled sometimes during the course, everyone was really helpful making sure I understood what the code means and how to write the code correctly.
        In my course I learnt the basics on how to create a navigation bar, how to add videos and images. I also learnt how to add elements, tags and CSS which was really helpful. I personally liked how the teachers went into depth about the code.
        Once completing the course and getting the experience, then more career options open up such as: becoming a web developer, a freelancer and even some software engineering roles.</p>

    <h2 style = "text-align:left; font-size: larger;">Web developer 3: </h2>
      <p style = "font-size: large; text-align: center;">Hi my name is Jake. I work at this company as a full-stack web developer. I applied through this website since 2021 and have been working here ever since. In order to apply for the job you need a degree in either computer science, software engineering or digital media development.
        I chose to work as a full-stack web developer as I get to create full websites for example both ends of a website which means I get to work on the design and what the user sees but also the code behind it. 
        The code I use is HTML because it is simple and easy to understand.
      </p>
